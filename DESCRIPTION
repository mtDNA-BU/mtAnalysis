Description: mtAnalysis is an R/BioConductor package for identifying and annotating mtDNA sequence variations. This package allows to identify mtDNA sequence variations with user-specified thresholds, and provide several plots to visualize mtDNA sequence variations. It also annotates all mtDNA variations and predicts functionality for mtDNA variants in the coding and tRNA regions.
