mtAnalysis is an R package for identifying and annotating mtDNA sequence
variations. This package allows to identify mtDNA sequence variations
with user-specified thresholds, and provide several plots to visualize
mtDNA sequence variations. It also annotates all mtDNA variations and
predicts functionality for mtDNA variants in the coding and tRNA
regions.
