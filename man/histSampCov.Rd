\usage{
histSampCov(coverage, loci = seq_len(.mtLength), type = "median", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{coverage}{a numeric matrix (16569 x N).
Rows correspond to loci and columns correspond to subjects.
This matrix contains the reads coverage of the 16569 mtDNA loci for each
subject. The matrix must contain the subject ID as the column names.}

\item{loci}{one of the following to specify mtDNA loci:
1. a numeric vector (default is c(1:16569)) of mitochondrial DNA loci,
2. a character string for the regions(e.g. "coding", "tRNA", "Dloop", â€¦).}

\item{type}{a string: "median" to calculate median coverage at individual
level, "mean" to calculate mean coverage at individual level}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to plot function.}
}
\description{
Produce a Histogram of Mean Coverage Across mtDNA Loci for
Subjects.

## Read input data
coverage_file <- "coverage.csv"
coverage <- as.matrix(read.csv(file=coverage_file, sep=",", header=FALSE))

histSampCov(coverage, loci="coding")
